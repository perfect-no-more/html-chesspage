  <h1>Here are some of my loose notes.</h1>
  <p>Prophylaxis means: no active play for my opponent in this game! I'm going to prevent everything. (There is no hurry in capitalizing in such a game.)
  <p>Good attitude when learning: I don't have to make perfect moves, but I want to make sure that I NEVER hang pieces (or checkmate)! (and that I capture hanging pieces of my opponent)</p>
  <p>Books to learn from:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bardwick - Chess endgame workbook. Acquiring skills to win close games</li>
